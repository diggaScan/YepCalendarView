# YepCalendarView
Custome Calendar View, which is capable of scrollign, clicking, long clicking and so on.   
Basically, the base effect emulates the google original widget CalendarView, with more interesting features like day state, unable days, etc. Meanwhiel, more customizing API will be exposed to the users like color, typeface, textsize, etc.
More expalnation will be conducted after I go through my code again. Yes, GO THROUGH MY OWN CODE !!!
